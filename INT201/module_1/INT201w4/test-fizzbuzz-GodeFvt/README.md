# Problem: FizzBuzz

Write a JavaScript function called _fizzBuzz(max)_ that takes a maximum value as input and generates the FizzBuzz pattern up to that value. The input value _max_ will be a positive integer. In the FizzBuzz pattern, replace numbers that are multiples of 3 with "Fizz," numbers that are multiples of 5 with "Buzz," and numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz." Return a single string that represents the entire pattern without spaces between terms.

## Output

A single string representing the FizzBuzz pattern without spaces between terms.

## Examples

### Example 1

Input: fizzBuzz(10)

Output: "12Fizz4BuzzFizz78FizzBuzz"

Explanation:

Numbers 3, 6, and 9 are replaced by "Fizz."
Numbers 5 and 10 are replaced by "Buzz."
The pattern generated up to 10 is "12Fizz4BuzzFizz78FizzBuzz"

### Example 2

Input: fizzBuzz(16)

Output: "12Fizz4BuzzFizz78FizzBuzz11Fizz1314FizzBuzz16"

Explanation:

Numbers 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 are replaced by "Fizz."
Numbers 5 and 10 are replaced by "Buzz."
Number 15 is replaced by "FizzBuzz."
The pattern generated up to 16 is "12Fizz4BuzzFizz78FizzBuzz11Fizz1314FizzBuzz16"
